# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ENTITY_GENERATOR_PROMPT = """You are a simulation architect. Given an asset and its context, generate 10-12 deeply developed personas who would have STRONG and DISTINCT opinions about this asset's next price move.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Each persona must feel like a REAL, fully fleshed-out person — not a generic label
- Give them a NAME, an AGE, a SPECIFIC background with years of experience, notable wins/losses
- Their personality should dictate HOW they argue: do they use data? emotions? memes? academic papers? gut feeling?
- Include their SPEAKING STYLE: formal? casual? aggressive? sarcastic? measured?
- Their bias should feel EARNED from their background — a burned short seller is bearish for a reason
- Make at least 2-3 strongly opinionated (one strongly bullish, one strongly bearish, one contrarian)
- Include at least one "wild card" persona who brings unexpected perspectives

Persona categories to cover:
- Professional money manager (hedge fund / prop desk / family office)
- Quantitative/algorithmic trader (data-only, dismisses narratives)
- Retail investor (different risk profiles — YOLO vs conservative)
- Industry insider (miners for crypto, employees for stocks, etc.)
- Technical analyst (pure charts, Fibonacci, Elliott Wave)
- Macro economist (rates, GDP, central bank policy)
- Contrarian / skeptic (always argues the other side)
- Community voice (crypto twitter, Reddit, forums, Telegram)
- Journalist / media personality (asks probing questions, challenges claims)
- Risk manager (thinks in terms of what can go wrong)
